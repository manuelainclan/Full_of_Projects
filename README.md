## Full of Projects 💡👩‍💻🎉

Hello! I'm Manuela Inclán, and I collaborated in the creation of this project called Full of Projects along with Marina Caro, Natalia Blanco, and Pilar Leiva.

You can see it live here! 👉 [full-of-projects.onrender.com](https://full-of-projects.onrender.com/)

Full of Projects is a tool that allows users to create custom cards to present and share information about their projects. With this tool, users can summarize the main data of their projects and authors in a personalized card that includes photos, links, and other relevant information.
